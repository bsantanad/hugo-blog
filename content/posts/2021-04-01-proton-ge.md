# install and use proton-ge build in steam

## create dir compatibilitytools.d

locate your steam installation, it probably is in your home directory
under _.local/share_:
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/Steam
```
here we will create a directory named **compatibilitytools.d**, so:
```bash
mkdir compatibilitytools.d
cd compatibilitytools.d
```

## download proton-ge

then we will open our browser and go to the [proton-ge repository][ge],
click on releases (if you clicked the link you are already there), here
are all the proton-ge releases, scroll
a bit and you'll see a dropdown menu: __Assets__, open it, and there will
be 3 files, two of them are the source code, we will need the other one.

It will be named something like __Proton-6.5-GE-1.tar.gz__, **the version
might change.**

Now that we have located it, will need to download it to the new directory
we just created, just copy the file url, and do:
```bash
wget <url you copied>
```
in my case it was:
```bash
wget https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/6.1-GE-2/Proton-6.1-GE-2.tar.gz
```
wait until the download is completed

## uncompress it

uncompress it
```bash
tar -v -xzf Proton-6.1-GE-2.tar.gz
```
**Your file name might be different**

remove the tar.gz
```bash
rm Proton-6.1-GE-2.tar.gz
```

if you do:

```bash
ls
```
you'll see a directory with the same name but withou the _tar.gz_
if you see it, you did everything right. :)

## steam

open steam, go to the top left corner, click on "_Steam_", then "_settings_",
select what is probably the last option "_Steam Play_", and in Advanced,
_Enable Steam Play for all other titles_, and check if in the dropdown menu
next to **"Run other titles with:"** you see the proton-ge version we've just
installed, if you do, congratulations! now you can use proton-ge to
run your titles.

that's it, is that simple.

enjoy :)
