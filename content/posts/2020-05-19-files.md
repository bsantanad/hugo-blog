## Into the Files

So in this post we are going to talk about the basic stuff you can do i
with a file, open, writing, reading you name it. This is the 5th
post in a series of post, in the [last one][ReLearning] we learned
all about arrays and strings, go check it out!

We are taking most of this course information from [here][page]. So if
you want better information, go there!

## FILES

Many times we want to open a file and write some information on it,
so when we exit the program and run it again we don't start from
scratch, the guy who created C makes this really easy for us. Here's
an example, and then will break it down.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){

    FILE *filePointer;
    char word1[10], word2[10], word3[10];
    int c;

    filePointer = fopen("test.in", "w+");

    fprintf(filePointer, "I love C!"); //Writes in file

    fputc(33, filePointer); //Add '!' Character to the file

    // Moves the position indicator of the file is set to the beginning
    rewind(filePointer);

    //Reads From File
    fscanf(filePointer, "%s %s %s", word1, word2, word3);
    printf("%s %s %s\n", word3, word2, word1);

    rewind(filePointer);

    //Read Char by Char
    while (1) {
        c = fgetc(filePointer);
        if (c != EOF){

            printf("%c", c);

        } else{
            break;
        }
    }


    fclose(filePointer); //Closes File
    return 0;
}
```
Output:

```bash

C!! love I
I love C!!

```
Okay, a big chunk of code I know, but pay attention, there's
almost everything you'll ever want to do with a file ever.

* How to open the text file
* How to write a String
* How to write a char
* How to read line by line with fscanf (The same as in the
example just use a _while fscanf() != EOF_)
* How to read char by char
* How to close it.

So that piece of code it's you little cheat sheet, so you
can do everything you want with text files.

Here's a list of the modes fopen allows.

| Open Mode        | What does it Do |
| ------------- |:---------------------------:|
| r      | Read |
| w      | Write (File shouldn't exists)      |
| a      | Append  |
| r+      | Reads and Writes  |
| w+     | Reads and Writes (Overwriting) |
| a+      | Reads and Writes (Appends if exists) |


## Binary

Just here for the code?

```c
#include<stdio.h>

struct Dog{

    char name[10];
    int age;

};


int main () {

    FILE *fileWriter;
    FILE *fileReader;

    struct Dog dogs[3] = {
                {"Shaggy",8},
                {"Doggy",6},
                {"Timmy",4}
    };

    struct Dog readDogs[5];

    fileWriter = fopen( "binary.in" , "w" );

    // Stores all the array of dogs
    fwrite(dogs , sizeof(dogs) , 1 , fileWriter );

    //Stores just two dogs
    fwrite(dogs, sizeof(struct Dog), 2, fileWriter);

    fclose(fileWriter);

    fileReader = fopen("binary.in", "r");

    // Reads two of the dogs stored in the file.
    fread(readDogs, sizeof(struct Dog), 2, fileReader);

    fclose(fileReader);

    printf("%s", readDogs[1].name);


    return 0;
}
```
Output:

```bash

Doggy

```
Okay, look this looks a little more complicated, but don't worry
it's just as easy.

When we want to store things into a binary file we use __fwrite()__
and when we want to read a binary file we use __fread()__

* __fwrite(ptr,size,howmany, file)__

* ptr = The direction of where you want to get the thing you'll write
* size = the size of the struct you want to store
* howmany = How many of the size you said before you want to store
* file = Pointer to file where you want to store them

* __freads(ptr, size, howmany, file)__

* ptr = Direction of where you want to store the read data.
* size = Size of what you want to read
* howmany, same as before in fwrite
* file = The file you want to read from

## Have Fun

Well, that was a little longer that I expected, I hope you can
come back to this post when you want to open a file in the future.
Cheers!
