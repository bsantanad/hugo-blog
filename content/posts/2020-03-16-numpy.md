I'll start by saying that I assume you have a little knowledge of Linear Algebra and Python. If you haven't read my past post, I'm reading a book called [Algorithms for dummies] [A4D], I'm currently on
chapter 5, and I will write what I have learned.

So, Numpy helps you a lot with the math and with managing your data.
For example, you can choose a data type for a variable just like you
would in a more low-level program, here's an example,

```python
import numpy as np

myShort = np.short(15)
```

This allows us to manipulate the data in a more accurate way. It has a
lot of data types, *int16, int32* and many [more.][data-types]

Numpy also helps you work with vectors, and matrices, in a much simpler
way,

```python
import numpy as np

myVector = np.array([1,3,5,7]) #This is how to declare a vector
myMatrix = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8]]) # This is one way declare a Matrix
myMatrixTwo = np.mat([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]) # Another way
```
The main difference in using *np.mat* and *np.array([],[])* is on the
operations, with np.mat you can do something like,

```python
matC = matA * matB # using np.mat
```
And it would multiply the matrices as you remember from linear algebra,
instead if you do the same but using *np.array* the matC[0] element would
be  matA[0] * matB[0]. This means it would multiply each element with
it's corresponding element in the other matrix. If you want to get the
product of the two matrices you would need to use,

```python
matC = matA.dot(matB) #using np.array
```
Here are other cool things you can do with numpy

```python
import numpy as np

#-------------Vectors--------------------------

myVect = np.arange(2,10,2) #Create an array from 2-10 skiping 3: (2,5,8)
myVectB = np.array([1,2,3,4], dtype=np.int16) # Create an array and define a type
myVect = np.ones(4, dtype=int) #Create an array with 4 ones
myVectA = myVectB + 1 #The result is (2,3,4,5)

#--------------Matrix-----------------------------------

myMatrix = np.ones([4,4]) #Creates matrix 4x4 filled with 1
myMatrix = np.mat([[1,2,3],
                  [4,5,6],
                  [7,8,9]])
myMatrixT = myMatrix.transpose()
myMatrixInv = np.linalg.inv(myMatrix) # Gets the inverse of the matrix

```

I think that will be it. A little cheat sheet of syntax.

Happy Coding,
