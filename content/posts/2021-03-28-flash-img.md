# dd

More detailed guide [here][rasp]

We'll see how to flash the image of an OS into a microsd, we want a microsd
because we're doing this for a raspberry pi.

## discover mount point

run:
```bash
lsblk -p
```
This will list all the block devices, in other words (less accurate), it will
allow us to know the name of the microsd we just connected.

See all the devices and filesystems listed? Good, now **connect your microsd**

run again:

```bash
lsblk -p
```

See the new device it just appeared. That's the one we are looking for, in
my case it was at the end: _/dev/mmcblk0_

Now let's unmount the device partitions (if they are mounted, you will know
this if they have a filesystem attached to them).

In my case these were mounted
```bash
umount /dev/mmcblk0p2
umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
```

## flash it

this is the super command that does all the work. **BE CAREFULL** read the
whole paragraf before running it

```bash
sudo dd if=<img-to-flash>.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress
```

the important part is the __of=__, if you write another block different
from the one we just discovered in the first step, you can erase the
partition of the linux system you are using.

In other words **make sure you write the device we just discovered**, in
my case /dev/mmcblk0.

Note that I'm not using the once we unmount, those are the partitions, and
we need to specify the device.

Read the command twice before running it.

Hope this is helpful,
happy coding :)
