## It's been a while

Hi! So I've not written a lot in the blog since 2 months ago. Some things
changed in my life. I got an Internship in Intel! Last Wednesday I received
the offer. Also, we have been in quarantine since March, I think it's
almost done.

Our last project from OS have been deployed haha. And it's going to be
in C, so I think it's a good time to take a look on this language I
haven't use in a while. To be honest I used a mixture of C/C++, so I
don't know exactly the differences, and I want to have a superb
understanding of C. You can do pretty much everything in it. So that's
the why of this post.

This, and the next set of posts (I hope) will be a guide into the
basics of C. So I'll hope you find good use in this.

I'll be using [this][page] website as reference so, if you need a deeper
look, go there.

## Hello World

Let's start with the basic Stuff, just a _Hello World:_

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Easy stuff right?

## Variables

Now to declare a variable is the same stuff as always, but hey
be careful __You most declare all your variables before any other
kind of statement.__

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x,y;

    printf("other statement");
    return 0;
}
```
## Input/Output

Just here for the code? Be my guest:

```c

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x;
    printf("Enter a Number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    printf("You wrote %d", x);
    getchar();

    return 0;
}

```
So _stdio.h_ means standard I/O, so there's printf to output stuff and
scanf to receive them.

So let's look at _scanf_. First you need a string that says what type
of variable to look for _"%d"_ stands for digit, the second parameter
_"&x"_ means where to store the variable, look that we used the _&_
because we want to send the direction not the value.

## If Statements

Did you really forgot this? Well no problem benja, I got you covered.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x;

    printf( "Enter a Number: " );
    scanf("%d", &x);
    x = x*5;
    if (x >= 15 && x<= 45 ){
        printf("Your number is greater than 2 but less than 10");
    }else{
        printf("Your number is %d", x);
    }
    return 0;
}

```
Nothing to say here, just it works just like any other Language.

## Loops

### For

Okay so we have __For__, it's pretty much the same, just in here you
have to declare the variable you'll use outside, it's kind of annoying
but no problem.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;

    for (i=0; i<10; i++){
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}

```

### While

While _this_ do _that_

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;

    while(i<10){
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Do While

So pretty much the same as while, but in here it will enter at
least once in the loop


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;

    i = 0;
    do{
      printf("Hi Mike!");
    } while(i!=0);
    return 0;
}

```
### Break and Continue

They exist here as well, that's dope!
_Break_ breaks the loop jeje
_Continue_ Continue with the next lap

## Functions

This makes your life a lot easier, it's pretty much a bunch of code
you can use multiple times without writing it a lot of times.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int module(int, int);

int main()
{
    int x,res;

    x = 0;
    printf("Write the number you want to get the mod 21 from: \n");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    res = module(x,21);
    printf("The module is %d", res);
    return 0;
}

int module(int x, int y){
    return x%y;
}
```
I'm pretty happy with what we have so far, so it just needs a
little more thing before we can continue with the more "Advanced" part.

## Switch

You will be putting a lot of if statements, don't worry,
[Dennis Ritchie][creator of c], got you covered.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = 10;

    printf("Write 10 or 20: ");
    scanf("%d", &a);

    switch ( a ) {
        case 10:
            printf("Well done!");
            break;
        case 20:
            printf("You're really good");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Are you serious?");
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

So, there you have it, the very basics of C, don't worry you'll
reap your eyes in no time trying to understand why the program doesn't
compile. It's not that simple, either way, see you in the other post.

## Compile

Almost forgot, if you don't remember how to compile the code here's
an example

```bash
     foo@bar:$ gcc myCode.c -o myName
```

We will be talking about Pointers and Structs in
the [next lesson][nextLesson]. See you there!


Happy Coding,
